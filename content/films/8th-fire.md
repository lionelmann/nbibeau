Out of the Anishinabe's Seven Fires comes the idea of the eighth: the settler community and Aboriginal peoples must come together for harmony and justice. "8th Fire" travels coast to coast with host and journalist Wab Kinew to show the need Canada has to mend its relationship with the Aboriginal people and offer a way to get it right the second time around. Today's indigenous population is of a new generation struggling to rediscover its culture while living in cities or reserves with third-world conditions.
